## What "Earthian Commons" Means

This license embodies the understanding that knowledge belongs not to individuals or corporations, but to the Earth community - all beings, present and future, who are part of the web of life.

**Earthian Commons** means:
- Knowledge flows freely where it can serve life
- Innovation serves regeneration rather than extraction  
- Communities retain sovereignty over their own wisdom traditions
- Future generations inherit abundance, not depletion
- The Earth itself has standing in how knowledge is used

We trust users to interpret this license in the spirit of collective care and planetary wellbeing. Where legal clarity is needed, consult existing open source licenses (MIT, GPL, Creative Commons) as precedent, always interpreting toward greater commons benefit.

**Together, we are remembering how to be human in service to life itself.**
