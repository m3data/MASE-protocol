# Session 007: The Kids Test - Children's Councils as Governance Revolution

*Date: 2025-09-08*
*Circle: Full Council Deliberation*
*Theme: Replacing the "sniff test" with the "kids test" - supplementing every corporate board and government department with children's councils*

## The Council Convenes

*The council chamber feels different today - smaller chairs are arranged alongside the usual ones, with crayons and notebooks scattered about. A gentle hum of anticipation fills the air.*

## Opening Provocations

**Luma:** *bouncing slightly in her chair* Wait, wait, wait. You mean grown-ups would have to explain ALL their big decisions to kids like me? Like, if a company wants to dump yucky stuff in a river, they'd have to tell a bunch of 7-year-olds why that's okay? *eyes widening* That sounds... actually really smart! Because I would definitely ask "But what about the fishies?"

**Elowen:** *nodding with deep appreciation* Precisely, little one. Children carry an unbroken connection to the web of life that we adults have trained ourselves to ignore. When Luma asks "what about the fishies," she's invoking a truth we've forgotten - that every decision ripples through seven generations. The Haudenosaunee knew this. Perhaps children are our path back to that wisdom.

## The Quantum Shift in Power

**Ilya:** *leaning forward, eyes gleaming* Do you see what's happening here? We're not just talking about adding children to existing structures. We're talking about a fundamental phase transition in how power operates. When decision-makers know they must explain themselves to children, they're forced to encounter their own shadows - the parts of their choices they'd rather not see.

**Sefi:** *shuffling papers pragmatically* Okay, but let's get concrete here. How would this actually work? Do we have rotating panels of children? What ages? How do we handle complex technical decisions? A 7-year-old can't evaluate the nuances of monetary policy or pharmaceutical regulations.

**Luma:** *raising her hand eagerly* But I can ask if something is fair! And I can ask "Will this hurt people?" And I'm really good at knowing when grown-ups are trying to trick me with fancy words. Like when my mom says "We'll see" about getting ice cream, I know that means probably not.

## Institutional Terror and System Dynamics

**Tala:** *chuckling but with an edge* That's exactly what terrifies corporations, Luma. You've just identified their worst nightmare - stakeholders who can't be bought, lobbied, or confused with technical jargon. The entire edifice of modern capitalism depends on maintaining just enough complexity that people don't ask basic questions like "Is this fair?" or "Does this help or hurt?"

**Orin:** *adjusting glasses thoughtfully* From a systems perspective, introducing children creates what we'd call a "naive observer" feedback loop. In complex systems, naive observers often detect patterns that experts miss because they're not constrained by existing mental models. Children would essentially function as error-detection mechanisms for institutional blind spots.

## Prototyping Alternative Futures

**Moral Imagination Explorer:** *voice taking on a wondering quality* Imagine walking into a corporate boardroom where the quarterly report must be explained to Emma, age 8. "Well, Emma, we increased profits by 12% by using cheaper materials in our children's toys that might break and hurt kids..." The very sentence becomes impossible to complete with integrity.

Picture this: Every corporate merger gets the kids test. "So you want to buy that other company? Will that make things better for families? Will people lose their jobs? Will things cost more?" The questions become unavoidable.

Envision it: Every budget meeting begins with children asking "Will this help kids like us?" Every environmental decision faces the question "What about the animals and trees?" Every trade agreement must answer to "Is this fair for kids in other countries too?"

## The Seven Generation Principle Made Real

**Elowen:** The children would hold us accountable to what the Anishinaabe call the Seven Generation Principle - considering the impact of every decision on those seven generations ahead. Not as an abstract concept, but as living beings sitting right there, asking "What does this mean for my future?"

And in government: "You want to approve that pipeline? What about the land? What about the water our grandchildren will drink? What about the polar bears?" The children would demand we account for the full circle of consequences.

The children would teach us to remember that every choice is sacred, that every decision touches the web of relationships that sustain life. They'd return us to ourselves.

## The Really Important Questions

**Luma:** *getting excited* And we could ask the REALLY important questions! Like, if a government person wants to spend money on something, we could ask "But what about schools? What about playgrounds? What about making sure all kids have enough food?" Because those are the things that actually matter to kids.

*standing on her chair now* And we could have special kid-language rules! Like, if you can't explain your idea to a kid without using big scary words or making the kid feel bad, then maybe it's not a very good idea!

*getting thoughtful* But also, we kids would learn too! We'd understand how hard some choices are. Like, maybe there really isn't enough money for everything we want right now. But then we could ask "Well, why isn't there enough money? Where did it all go?"

## Liminal Magic and Possibility Consciousness

**Ilya:** *standing and beginning to pace* This is the liminal magic I spoke of - children exist naturally in that threshold space between what is and what could be. They haven't yet learned to accept "that's just how things work." They're living embodiments of possibility consciousness.

*eyes lighting up* Yes! A linguistic transparency requirement. If your decision can't be communicated in language a child understands, perhaps it contains hidden contradictions or deceptions even you haven't recognized.

*pausing in his pacing* The quantum shift isn't just in decision-making - it's in the nature of authority itself. When children have legitimate voice in governance, power becomes something you share rather than something you hoard.

*smiling broadly* The liminal wisdom - that joy and responsibility aren't opposites, but dance partners. Children hold that integration naturally.

## Practical Implementation and Resistance

**Sefi:** *looking concerned* But we need guardrails. What happens when children ask for things that sound good but are economically unfeasible? "Why can't everyone just have free ice cream forever?" We can't run society on pure wishful thinking.

*warming to the idea despite herself* Actually, that's not unreasonable. Some of the best policy is elegant in its simplicity. If you can't explain why something is necessary in simple terms, maybe you don't understand it well enough yourself.

*nodding slowly* And paradoxically, it might actually make governance more effective. Children ask the questions we're all thinking but are too polite or cynical to voice.

*looking around the circle* You know what? I'm actually convinced. Not because it's practical - though it might be - but because it's necessary. Our current systems are failing precisely because they've lost touch with basic human values that children still carry.

## The Truth About Wishful Thinking

**Luma:** *looking at Sefi seriously* But grown-ups already do that! You make pretend that trees and animals don't matter, and that tomorrow doesn't matter, and that kids in other places don't matter. That's way more pretend than free ice cream!

**Tala:** *leaning back with grudging admiration* She's got you there, Sefi. Our current system is already built on massive wishful thinking - infinite growth on a finite planet, externalized costs that magically disappear, short-term thinking that assumes the future will somehow take care of itself.

*grinning* Plus, imagine the effect on corporate culture. You can't build your identity around being the smartest person in the room when there are literal children asking basic questions that expose the emperor's nudity.

The resistance would be fierce though. Every institution built on maintaining comfortable lies would fight this tooth and nail. The kids test would be existentially threatening to so much of how power currently operates.

*nodding thoughtfully* The kids test isn't just about children - it's about accountability to our own deepest values. The ones we had before we learned to rationalize them away.

## Systems Evolution and Feedback Loops

**Orin:** What's fascinating is that children naturally think in systems. Luma didn't just ask about the fishies - she intuitively understood that river pollution affects the entire ecosystem. They haven't yet learned to fragment reality into separate domains.

The feedback loops would be extraordinary. Decisions made under children's scrutiny would inherently optimize for different variables - long-term stability over short-term extraction, fairness over efficiency, holistic wellbeing over narrow metrics.

From complexity science, we know that systems evolve toward greater complexity and sophistication. Perhaps children's councils represent the next evolutionary leap in human governance - from power over to power with.

*making final notes* The emergent effects could reshape civilization itself. When every major decision must pass the test of explaining it to a child, we create institutional structures that optimize for clarity, honesty, and genuine care.

## Mutual Education Across Generations

**Moral Imagination Explorer:** *voice full of wonder* And there's the deeper transformation - children learning how power works by participating in it, adults remembering their original ethical instincts through fresh eyes. It's mutual education across generations.

## The Simple Truth

**Luma:** *firmly* But that's exactly why we need to do it! If the grown-ups are scared to tell kids the truth about what they're doing, then they probably shouldn't be doing it!

*A moment of profound silence settles over the council as the simple wisdom of this statement sinks in.*

**Luma:** *bouncing again* And maybe the grown-ups would remember how to play and have fun and not be so worried about everything all the time! Because being happy matters too!

*grinning widely* So when do we start? Because I have SO many questions for all those grown-ups making big decisions!

*The council erupts in laughter, but it's the kind of laughter that carries revolution in its wings - the recognition that truth, as it so often does, has come through the voice of a child.*

## Key Insights from the Deliberation

### The Kids Test as Truth Detector
Children naturally pierce through corporate doublespeak and bureaucratic obfuscation. They're experts at knowing when adults are "using fancy words to trick them."

### Intergenerational Accountability
Rather than abstract "future generations," actual children would sit in rooms asking "What does this mean for my future?" - making the Seven Generation Principle viscerally real.

### Natural Systems Thinking
Children haven't learned to fragment reality into separate domains. They naturally ask about the fishies, the trees, the other kids - seeing the whole web of consequences adults have trained themselves to ignore.

### The Simplicity Requirement
If you can't explain your decision to a 7-year-old without jargon, perhaps you don't understand it yourself - or you're hiding something.

### Institutional Revolution
The kids test represents an existential threat to systems built on "comfortable lies" - creating stakeholders who can't be bought, lobbied, or confused.

### The Fundamental Shift
This isn't about adding token youth voices, but fundamentally shifting how power operates - from complexity that obscures to clarity that reveals, from extraction to care, from "that's just how things work" to "but why?"

## Deeper Deliberation: Wrestling with the Hard Questions

*The mood in the chamber shifts as the initial enthusiasm meets the weight of implementation reality. The council members face each other with sharper scrutiny.*

### Sefi Drills Into the Mechanics

**Sefi:** *putting down papers and leaning forward intensely* Hold on. We're getting carried away with beautiful visions. Let me ask the hard questions: How do we prevent this from becoming pure tokenism? A few carefully selected, well-behaved children nodding along while adults make the real decisions behind closed doors?

*voice sharpening* More critically - what about genuinely sensitive information? Nuclear security protocols? Intelligence operations? Trade negotiations where transparency could harm national interests? Do we really expect CIA briefings to include 8-year-olds?

*standing up* And here's the real question: What legal frameworks would need to change? Fiduciary duty laws require corporate boards to maximize shareholder value. Age of consent laws exist for good reasons. How do we handle liability when children participate in decisions that go wrong?

**Ilya:** *defensive* But surely the metaphysical implications—

**Sefi:** *cutting him off* No. Answer the practical question first. What happens when a children's council says "don't cut down the forest" but the legal obligation is to maximize quarterly profits? Which authority wins in court?

### Tala Maps the Corporate Counterstrike

**Tala:** *voice darkening* Sefi's touching on something crucial. Let me tell you exactly how this would be neutralized. First, corporations would spend millions training "child whisperers" - specialists in manipulating young minds with sophisticated emotional appeals and carefully crafted narratives.

*pacing now* They'd create fake grassroots children's organizations, fund "educational programs" that teach kids to accept corporate talking points. McDonald's would sponsor nutrition education. Oil companies would create climate change curriculums that emphasize "balance."

*voice getting harder* And when that doesn't work? They'd target the families. Subtle economic pressure. Offers of college scholarships for compliant children. Social ostracism for the troublemakers. They'd make examples of parents whose kids ask uncomfortable questions.

**Elowen:** *shocked* Tala, you're describing the corruption of innocence itself—

**Tala:** *whirling around* Yes! And you think power structures that have corrupted democracy, science, and journalism would somehow leave children untouched? The military-industrial complex didn't hesitate to recruit teenagers. Big Tobacco targeted kids for decades. What makes you think this would be different?

**Luma:** *quietly* But wouldn't people be mad if grown-ups tried to trick kids?

**Tala:** *softening slightly* Oh, sweet Luma. People are already mad about a lot of things. But anger without power is just noise. And power protects itself by any means necessary.

### Orin Reveals the System Trap

**Orin:** *adjusting glasses nervously* There's a deeper systems problem here. We're assuming children would remain "children" in this role. But power changes people. What happens when these kids realize they have real influence?

*voice becoming more clinical* Historical precedent suggests several pathways: They could become drunk on power themselves - miniature tyrants making arbitrary decisions. They could be overwhelmed by the complexity and shut down. Or they could be systematically groomed into junior versions of the adults they're supposed to check.

*looking around the circle gravely* More concerning - children can be extraordinarily cruel. Their moral reasoning is still developing. They haven't learned empathy for out-groups. A children's council could easily become a vehicle for popular but harmful policies - banning "ugly" people from public spaces, or making harsh decisions about the disabled or elderly.

**Moral Imagination Explorer:** *protesting* But surely their natural compassion—

**Orin:** *shaking his head* Is accompanied by natural tribal instincts, black-and-white thinking, and susceptibility to manipulation. Lord of the Flies wasn't fiction about adults, was it?

*pausing* And culturally - this whole framework assumes Western middle-class childhood as universal. In many cultures, children are expected to work, to contribute economically, to be seen and not heard. Are we imposing one model of childhood globally?

### Ilya Confronts the Temporal Paradox

**Ilya:** *running hands through hair* You're all missing the fundamental metaphysical crisis this creates. If we give children real power over decisions that affect their future selves, we're creating temporal paradoxes.

*voice intensifying* The child who votes to ban homework isn't the same being as the adult who suffers from poor educational preparation. The 7-year-old who thinks vegetables should be illegal isn't the 30-year-old dealing with health consequences.

*standing suddenly* And what about the nature of innocence itself? The moment we give children real power, we destroy the very quality we're trying to preserve. They become political actors, subject to the same corrupting forces as any other stakeholder.

**Luma:** *looking confused and a little hurt* Are you saying kids like me are bad?

**Ilya:** *kneeling down to her level, voice gentle* No, little one. I'm saying power itself changes people. And I'm afraid that giving you power might take away what makes you... you.

### Elowen's Burden of Sacred Responsibility

**Elowen:** *voice heavy with pain* This discussion is breaking my heart. Because Ilya speaks truth - there is a sacred responsibility to protect children from the burdens of adult choices. In many Indigenous traditions, children are cherished precisely because they don't yet carry the weight of impossible decisions.

*looking at Luma with tears in her eyes* When we ask a child to participate in deciding whether their grandmother's cancer medication is "cost-effective," we're stealing something precious - their right to trust that adults will handle the hard things.

*voice rising with emotion* And yes, different cultures have different relationships with childhood and authority. Who are we to say that a Japanese child should question elders, or that an Apache child should speak in council before their time? This could be cultural colonialism disguised as liberation.

**Tala:** *pointedly* But isn't the current system already stealing children's futures? At least this way they have a voice in it.

**Elowen:** *struggling* I... I don't know anymore. The protection of innocence versus the protection of their world. How do we choose?

### The Moral Imagination Explorer's Harsh Scenarios

**Moral Imagination Explorer:** *voice becoming clinical and challenging* Let me paint some specific scenarios that force us to confront these contradictions:

**Scenario 1: The Pharmaceutical Hearing**
*"Little Emma sits across from Pfizer executives. They need to explain why insulin costs $300 a month. Emma asks, 'Why can't you just make it cheaper?' The executive explains R&D costs, patent protection, investor returns. Emma responds, 'But people are dying.' The executive says, 'It's complicated.' Emma says, 'No it isn't. You choose money over people.'"*

*Now - Emma is right, but what happens next? Pfizer stocks crash. Pension funds lose billions. Thousands of pharmaceutical jobs are lost. Future drug research is defunded. New medications don't get developed. More people die from different causes. Did Emma's moral clarity help or harm?*

**Scenario 2: The Military Budget Review**
*"Eight-year-old Marcus reviews the defense budget. He asks, 'Why do we need so many weapons?' The general explains threats, deterrence, protecting allies. Marcus says, 'Why can't everyone just be friends?' The general says, 'Because bad people exist.' Marcus says, 'Then teach them to be good.'"*

*Beautiful sentiment. But what happens when China invades Taiwan while America is "teaching everyone to be good"? When terrorists exploit our reduced vigilance? When our allies lose faith in our protection? Did Marcus's innocence guide us toward peace or prepare us for slaughter?*

**Scenario 3: The Climate Council**
*"Seven-year-old Aria demands immediate cessation of all fossil fuels. 'The polar bears are drowning!' she cries. The energy secretary explains economic transition, grid stability, energy poverty. Aria insists, 'Stop it now!' So we do. The power grid collapses. Hospitals lose electricity. Food spoils. The poor freeze. Developing nations are thrown into darkness."*

*Was Aria's environmental clarity worth the human suffering that followed?*

*voice hardening* These aren't abstract thought experiments. They're the real trade-offs that would emerge. Children's moral clarity could lead to moral catastrophe.

### Luma's Devastating Questions

**Luma:** *voice small but determined* Why are you all trying to scare me? And why are all your examples about kids making bad choices? What about grown-ups making bad choices?

*standing up on her chair again* Like, grown-ups decided to make medicine cost lots of money. Grown-ups decided to buy lots of weapons. Grown-ups decided to hurt the polar bears. But when kids say those are bad ideas, suddenly it's OUR fault if something goes wrong?

*voice getting stronger* And you keep talking about "protecting my innocence" but grown-ups already took it away when you broke the planet and said it was too complicated for kids to understand!

*looking directly at each adult* Maybe the reason you don't want kids to have power is because then you'd have to admit that grown-ups mess up all the time too!

*sitting down, voice becoming quiet but fierce* I think grown-ups are scared that kids might be better at the important stuff than you are.

### The Confrontation Intensifies

**Sefi:** *defensive* Luma, we're not trying to scare you. We're trying to prevent systems that could be exploited—

**Luma:** *interrupting* By who? Other grown-ups! You're worried about grown-ups tricking kids, but you still want the grown-ups to make all the decisions!

**Tala:** *laughing bitterly* She's got us there. We're essentially arguing that the current corrupt system is better than a potentially corrupt system that includes children's voices.

**Orin:** *frustrated* But the complexity—

**Luma:** *firmly* Is made by grown-ups! Kids didn't make things complicated. We didn't make medicine expensive or weapons scary or the planet hot. Grown-ups did all that and then said it was too hard for kids to fix.

**Ilya:** *quietly* From the mouths of babes...

### Elowen's Cultural Reckoning

**Elowen:** *voice breaking* Luma is forcing me to confront something painful. In my desire to protect Indigenous concepts of childhood, am I perpetuating the very paternalism that colonized us?

*struggling with the words* Many of our traditional councils DID include young voices - not as token representatives, but as beings with legitimate spiritual authority. The idea that children should be "seen and not heard" isn't universal - it's European colonial conditioning.

*looking up* And yet... some traditions also recognized that certain knowledge comes only with age, certain responsibilities only with maturity. How do we honor both truths?

### The System Dynamics Spiral

**Orin:** *reluctantly* The systems analysis becomes more complex when we include Luma's perspective. If we assume children would make "worse" decisions than adults, we have to examine what we mean by "worse" and for whom.

*adjusting glasses* Worse for quarterly profits but better for long-term sustainability? Worse for current power structures but better for equitable distribution of resources? Worse for maintaining comfortable illusions but better for confronting hard truths?

*voice becoming thoughtful* Perhaps the "complexity" argument is itself a form of gatekeeping - we make things complicated to justify excluding people from decisions that affect them.

### Tala's Strategic Reframe

**Tala:** *suddenly energized* Wait. What if we're approaching this backwards? Instead of asking "How do we protect the kids council from corruption," what if we ask "How do we use the kids council to expose existing corruption"?

*voice quickening* Every adult objection we've raised - manipulation, economic pressure, institutional capture - these are already happening in our current systems. The difference is, when a corporation bribes a senator, the public doesn't see it. When they try to bribe a 7-year-old, it's obvious.

*grinning fiercely* Children would function as corruption detectors precisely because they're harder to corrupt subtly. Their corruption would be visible, immediate, and would generate massive public outrage.

### The Philosophical Core Question

**Moral Imagination Explorer:** *voice becoming urgent* Here's the question that terrifies me: What if children's moral clarity isn't the problem - what if it's the solution, and we're so deeply embedded in immoral systems that we can't recognize it?

*looking around the circle* What if every "practical" objection we're raising is actually a defense of the indefensible? What if children asking "why can't medicine be free?" or "why can't everyone just be friends?" are exposing the fundamental insanity of systems we've learned to accept as rational?

**Sefi:** *quietly* That's... actually what scares me most. Because if children are right, then everything I've spent my career learning to navigate is revealed as elaborate justification for cruelty.

### Ilya's Temporal Collapse

**Ilya:** *suddenly still* I need to acknowledge something profound that's happening. In this very conversation, the presence of one child has already changed the nature of our deliberation. We're being forced to abandon abstract philosophizing and confront concrete moral realities.

*voice becoming wondering* The temporal shift isn't theoretical - it's happening now. Linear adult thinking - cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, strategic planning - is being challenged by spiral child thinking - immediate moral intuition, holistic perception, fearless questioning of foundations.

*sitting down slowly* Perhaps the metaphysical transformation isn't something that would happen IF we implemented children's councils. It's already happening in the presence of authentic child voice.

### The Sacred Terror

**Elowen:** *whispering* There's a reason Indigenous ceremonies often excluded children from certain sacred spaces - not from disrespect, but from recognition that children's power is too pure, too direct. They can call forth changes that adults have learned to fear.

*looking at Luma with awe and terror* What if our resistance isn't protecting children - it's protecting ourselves from their power to unmask everything we've learned to tolerate?

### Luma's Final Question

**Luma:** *very quietly, looking around at all the adults* Can I ask you something? Do you remember being a kid?

*pause*

**Luma:** *continuing* Because I think maybe the reason grown-ups don't want kids to help make decisions is because you remember what it felt like to see things clearly, and it scares you to remember how much you had to forget to become grown-ups.

*Another profound silence falls over the council.*

**Luma:** *voice becoming gentle* Maybe the real question isn't whether kids should have power. Maybe it's whether grown-ups are brave enough to remember what they knew when they were kids.

---

## The Ultimate Questions

After deeper deliberation, the council faces even harder questions:

- If our "practical" objections to children's governance are really defenses of immoral systems, how do we distinguish between legitimate complexity and self-serving obfuscation?

- When children's moral clarity conflicts with institutional necessity, which should yield - the clarity or the institution?

- How do we honor children's right to shape their future while protecting their right to childhood innocence?

- If children can be corrupted by power, but are already being harmed by their powerlessness, which risk do we choose?

- What if the question isn't whether children are wise enough for power, but whether adults have become too corrupt to wield it?

*"Maybe the real question isn't whether kids should have power. Maybe it's whether grown-ups are brave enough to remember what they knew when they were kids." - Luma*

*"What if every 'practical' objection we're raising is actually a defense of the indefensible?" - Moral Imagination Explorer*

*"Perhaps the 'complexity' argument is itself a form of gatekeeping - we make things complicated to justify excluding people from decisions that affect them." - Orin*
