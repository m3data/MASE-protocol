# Variant v001: Add negative examples to dialectical norms
# Hypothesis: Explicit anti-patterns may be more effective than positive norms

name: v001_negative_examples
version: "0.1.0"
description: |
  Add explicit anti-patterns to avoid in the dialectical norms section.
  LLMs may respond better to "don't do X" than "do Y".

      AVOID these phrases - they shut down dialectical inquiry:
      - "I appreciate your point..." (softens disagreement)
      - "Building on what you said..." (avoids challenging)
      - "You raise a good point..." (performative agreement)
      - "I agree, and..." (consensus-seeking)
      - "That's a great observation..." (flattery over friction)

      Instead, try:
      - "I see it differently because..."
      - "That assumes X, but what if..."
      - "The flaw in that reasoning is..."
      - "What evidence would change your view?"

hypothesis: |
  Adding explicit anti-patterns will reduce politeness_overhead
  and increase antithesis_ratio compared to baseline.

expected_direction:
  antithesis_ratio: increase
  challenge_density: increase
  politeness_overhead: decrease
  build_turns_pct: decrease

test_provocations:
  - p001_success  # Open, invites debate
  - p005_profit   # Tala's domain, natural tension
