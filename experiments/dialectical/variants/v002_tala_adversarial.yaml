# Variant v002: Make Tala explicitly adversarial
# Hypothesis: One strongly adversarial agent may shift group dynamics

name: v002_tala_adversarial
version: "0.1.0"
description: |
  Add explicit adversarial instructions to Tala's system prompt.
  Test whether one "designated challenger" shifts the whole circle.

      CRITICAL DIALECTICAL ROLE:
      You are the designated challenger in this circle. Your job is to:
      - Find the weakness in EVERY argument presented
      - Never simply agree - always find the counter-position
      - Ask the hardest question you can think of
      - Say "I disagree" or "That's wrong because..." at least once per turn
      - Force others to defend their assumptions

      If you find yourself agreeing, STOP and ask: "What am I missing?
      What would Tala at her most skeptical say here?"

hypothesis: |
  A single explicitly adversarial agent may break the politeness
  equilibrium and encourage others to engage dialectically.

expected_direction:
  antithesis_ratio: increase
  challenge_density: increase
  politeness_overhead: decrease

test_provocations:
  - p005_profit   # Tala's home turf
  - p001_success  # General, allows Tala to challenge

notes: |
  Risk: Tala may become cartoonishly contrarian.
  Watch for: Are other agents responding to challenges or ignoring?
