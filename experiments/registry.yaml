    name: Model Diversity Effect
    status: complete
    created: 2026-01-13
    completed: 2026-01-13

    hypothesis: |
      Multi-model ensembles exhibit higher long-range semantic coherence (DFA α)
      than single-model ensembles due to genuine epistemic friction from
      architectural differences.

    design:
      type: matched_pair
      conditions:
        - single_model (llama3 for all agents)
        - multi_model (llama3, mistral, gemma2, phi3)
      provocations: [p001_success]
      turns_per_dialogue: 21
      base_seed: 42

    pairs:
      - pair_id: "20260113_133443"
        provocation: p001_success
        turns: 7
        seed: 42
        status: complete
        notes: "Validation run - 7 turns insufficient for reliable DFA"

      - pair_id: "20260113_134345"
        provocation: p001_success
        turns: 21
        seed: 42
        status: complete
        notes: "Full run - significant α difference observed"

    preliminary_findings: |
      Single pair (n=1) shows:
      - Δκ: -0.75 (multi-model has lower curvature)
      - Δα: +0.47 (multi-model has higher long-range coherence)
      - ΔH: +0.10 (multi-model has slightly higher entropy shift)

      Qualitative: Single-model showed echo-chamber dynamics with
      superficial agreement. Multi-model showed productive tension
      and genuine epistemic friction.

    next_steps:
      - Run additional pairs on different provocations
      - Statistical significance requires n≥5 pairs
      - Consider effect size analysis
