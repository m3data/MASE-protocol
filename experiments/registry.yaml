    name: Model Diversity Effect
    status: complete

    completed: 2026-01-13

    hypothesis: |
      Multi-model ensembles exhibit higher long-range semantic coherence (DFA α)
      than single-model ensembles due to genuine epistemic friction from
      architectural differences.

    design:
      type: matched_pair
      conditions:
        - single_model (llama3 for all agents)
        - multi_model (llama3, mistral, gemma2, phi3)
      provocations: [p001_success]
      turns_per_dialogue: 21
      base_seed: 42

    pairs:
      - pair_id: "20260113_133443"
        provocation: p001_success

        status: complete
        notes: "Δα=+0.47, supports H1"

        provocation: p002_children
        turns: 21
        seed: 43
        status: complete
        notes: "Δα=-0.93, opposes H1"

        provocation: p004_land

        provocation: p005_profit
        turns: 21
        seed: 46
        status: complete
        notes: "Δα=+0.86, supports H1"

    final_results: |
      n=5 matched pairs completed. H1 NOT SUPPORTED.

      Aggregate results:
      - Mean Δα: -0.38 (opposite of prediction)
      - Mean Δκ: -0.40 (multi-model has lower curvature)
      - t-test: t=-0.88, p=0.43 (not significant)
      - Cohen's d: -0.39 (small effect)

      2/5 pairs supported H1 (p001_success, p005_profit)
      3/5 pairs opposed H1 (p002_children, p003_emergency, p004_land)

      Key insight: Effect is provocation-dependent, not a general property
      of model diversity. Both H1-supporting provocations involve
      systems/markets framing.

    next_steps:
      - Qualitative analysis of dialogue content
      - Provocation property analysis
      - Alternative metrics exploration
      - E002 hypothesis design

  E002:
    id: E002
    name: Personality Effect on Basin Distribution
    status: ready
    created: 2026-01-13

    hypothesis: |
      Sessions with Big Five personality-enabled agents will spend more time in
      "Collaborative Inquiry" and less in "Cognitive Mimicry" compared to
      base-temperature sessions, because personality traits create behavioral
      diversity through both prompt and parameter space.

    design:
      type: matched_pair
      conditions:
        - personality_enabled (multi_model.yaml with Big Five active)
        - no_personality (multi_model_no_personality.yaml)
      provocations: [p001_success, p004_land, p005_profit]
      turns_per_dialogue: 21
      seeds: [100, 101]

    metrics:
      primary: inquiry_vs_mimicry_ratio
      secondary:
        - voice_distinctiveness
        - coherence_pattern_distribution
        - dfa_alpha

    depends_on:
      - E001 (model diversity baseline)
      - v0.6.0 (Big Five personality system)
