# Sample MASE Provocations

A collection of opening questions and scenarios tested in MASE sessions, organized by complexity level and theme.

## Beginner Provocations

These work well for first sessions and new facilitators:

### Individual & Collective Balance
*"How do we balance individual freedom with collective responsibility in an interconnected world?"*

**Why it works**: Clear tension, accessible to all agents, connects to daily life experiences.

### Community Building
*"What makes a community truly inclusive rather than just saying it welcomes everyone?"*

**Why it works**: Concrete focus, allows both idealistic and pragmatic responses, Luma can relate to school/neighborhood experiences.

### Future Preparation
*"How should we prepare children for an uncertain future when we don't know what's coming?"*

**Why it works**: Every agent has stake, bridges present and future, invites both wisdom traditions and innovative thinking.

### Technology & Humanity
*"As AI becomes more capable, what makes us distinctly human - and does that matter?"*

**Why it works**: Relevant to current moment, allows philosophical and practical responses, good for exploring identity and value.

## Intermediate Provocations

These require some familiarity with MASE dynamics:

### Governance Innovation  
*"What would governance look like if designed by those most affected by its decisions rather than those with the most power?"*

**Why it works**: Challenges existing systems, allows agents to imagine alternatives, connects power dynamics to lived experience.

### Economic Transformation
*"How might we organize economic systems to serve life and flourishing rather than growth and accumulation?"*

**Why it works**: Fundamental systemic question, allows critique and vision, connects to environmental and social concerns.

### Healing at Scale
*"What does healing look like at the scale of communities and cultures, not just individuals?"*

**Why it works**: Bridges personal and political, allows both traditional and innovative approaches, good for exploring collective trauma.

### Education Reimagined
*"If we designed education from scratch to serve children's full potential rather than institutional needs, what would we create?"*

**Why it works**: Everyone has education experience, allows critique of current systems, Luma can lead with authentic child perspective.

## Advanced Provocations

These work best with experienced facilitators and established agent relationships:

### Metacrisis Navigation
*"How do we navigate the metacrisis - the crisis of how we create crises - without falling into either apocalyptic despair or naive optimism?"*

**Why it works**: Complex systems thinking required, allows multiple timeframes, pushes beyond simple solutions.

### Technology & Flourishing
*"What would it mean to design technology that serves collective flourishing rather than individual engagement and corporate profit?"*

**Why it works**: Challenges fundamental assumptions, requires imagining entirely different value systems, connects to current AI moment.

### Institutional Complexity
*"How might we create institutions that can hold complexity without becoming paralyzed by it, and remain responsive without becoming reactive?"*

**Why it works**: Paradox at the center, requires systems thinking, allows both critique and design, no easy answers.

### Wisdom & Implementation
*"How do we bridge the gap between knowing what would create a better world and actually implementing those changes at scale?"*

**Why it works**: The implementation gap that every session eventually encounters, allows both idealistic and pragmatic responses.

## Specialized Themes

### Environmental & Ecological

**Climate Action**: *"Given what we know about climate change, how do we balance the urgency of action with the need for just and inclusive solutions?"*

**More-than-Human**: *"How might we design human systems that account for the needs and agency of the more-than-human world?"*

**Bioregional**: *"What would it mean to organize our communities and economies around the ecological boundaries of place rather than political ones?"*

### Social Justice & Equity

**Systemic Change**: *"How do we address systemic oppression without reproducing the same power dynamics in our solutions?"*

**Cultural Healing**: *"What would true reconciliation look like between communities with histories of harm, and how do we get there?"*

**Economic Justice**: *"How might we create economic systems that repair historical harm while building sustainable abundance?"*

### Technology & Society

**AI Governance**: *"How do we govern artificial intelligence in ways that serve human flourishing while remaining adaptive to rapid technological change?"*

**Digital Communities**: *"What would social media look like if designed to strengthen communities rather than capture attention?"*

**Technological Wisdom**: *"How do we cultivate wisdom alongside technological power, ensuring our tools serve our deepest values?"*

### Intergenerational & Future-Focused  

**Ancestor Wisdom**: *"How do we honor ancestral wisdom while remaining adaptive to unprecedented challenges our ancestors never faced?"*

**Future Generations**: *"What do we owe future generations, and how do we include their voices in decisions that will shape their world?"*

**Cultural Evolution**: *"How might human cultures evolve to better serve both individual flourishing and collective thriving?"*

## Provocation Design Guidelines

### What Makes a Good MASE Provocation

1. **Multiple Valid Perspectives**: No single "right" answer, allows agents to genuinely disagree
2. **Real Stakes**: Connects to actual problems people face or decisions that matter  
3. **Accessible Core**: Can be understood by Luma while allowing sophisticated exploration
4. **Generative Tension**: Contains productive paradoxes or competing values
5. **Action Implications**: Could theoretically lead to different ways of living or organizing

### Structure Templates

**Tension Format**: *"How do we balance [value A] with [value B] when both seem essential?"*

**Vision Format**: *"What would [system/practice] look like if designed to serve [deeper value] rather than [current driver]?"*

**Implementation Format**: *"Given that we know [problem/solution], how do we actually [implement/overcome] [specific challenge]?"*

**Evolution Format**: *"How might [current system] evolve to better serve [emerging needs/values] without losing [essential function]?"*

### Red Flags to Avoid

- **Too narrow**: Only allows one or two agents to meaningfully engage
- **Too abstract**: Can't connect to lived experience or practical action  
- **False binary**: Sets up either/or when both/and thinking is needed
- **Predetermined answer**: Facilitator already knows what they want agents to conclude
- **Too triggering**: Involves trauma or harm without proper container for processing

## Session Timing Considerations

### 60-90 Minute Sessions
Use **Beginner** provocations. Focus on establishing agent voices and cross-referencing patterns.

### 2-3 Hour Sessions  
Use **Intermediate** provocations. Allow time for deep tension exploration and translation protocols.

### Extended Sessions (3+ Hours)
Use **Advanced** provocations. Include multiple meta-circles and agent reflection time.

## Adapting Provocations for Different Contexts

### Academic Settings
- Add theoretical frameworks and research connections
- Include discipline-specific perspectives
- Connect to current scholarly debates

### Community Groups
- Ground in local experience and immediate concerns
- Include diverse community voices as additional agents
- Focus on actionable insights and next steps  

### Organizational Contexts
- Connect to specific institutional challenges
- Include stakeholder perspectives as agents
- Balance visionary thinking with operational realities

### Personal Development
- Include psychological and spiritual dimensions
- Add agents representing different life stages or aspects of self
- Focus on integration and embodied practice

*These provocations have been tested in MASE sessions and refined based on what generates the most productive agent engagement and emergent insights. Feel free to adapt them for your context and share innovations back to the community.*
