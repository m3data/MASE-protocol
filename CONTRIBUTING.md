# Contributing to MASE

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MASE (Many Agent Socratic Exploration) project! This document outlines how to contribute meaningfully to this evolving methodology for collective wisdom and dialogue.

## üå± Philosophy of Contribution

MASE is released as **Earthian Commons** - knowledge that belongs to the Earth community and serves life. Contributions should embody the same spirit:

- **Serve collective wellbeing** rather than individual advancement
- **Honor diverse ways of knowing** and different epistemologies  
- **Center accessibility** - especially to those who inherit consequences
- **Build on existing wisdom** rather than claiming originality
- **Share learnings openly** to strengthen the whole ecosystem

## üöÄ Ways to Contribute

### 1. Share Your MASE Sessions
**Most Valuable**: Document and share your own MASE sessions!

- Complete session transcripts with insights and reflections
- Agent innovations or specialized ensembles  
- Provocations that generated breakthrough insights
- Translation moments where complex ideas became accessible
- Documentation of paradigm shifts or unexpected discoveries

**How to submit**: 
- Fork the repository
- Add your session to `/community_sessions/`
- Include agent reflection journals if available
- Submit pull request with session summary

### 2. Develop New Agent Personas
**High Impact**: Create agents for specific contexts or perspectives

Needed agent types:
- **Cultural specialists** (different traditions, regions, languages)
- **Demographic voices** (age groups, life experiences, backgrounds)  
- **Professional expertise** (legal, medical, scientific, artistic)
- **Accessibility advocates** (disability justice, neurodiversity)
- **Marginalized perspectives** often missing from dominant dialogues

**Agent development guidelines**:
- Ensure authentic voice, not stereotypical representation
- Include epistemology, not just expertise
- Design for conversational learning, not lecture delivery
- Test with community members from that perspective when possible

### 3. Create Educational Resources
**Community Building**: Help others learn and implement MASE

- Tutorial videos or walkthroughs
- Workshop curricula for different contexts (academic, community, organizational)
- Case studies of MASE application in real-world settings
- Research on outcomes and effectiveness
- Integration guides for other dialogue methodologies

### 4. Expand Methodological Innovation  
**Protocol Development**: Evolve the MASE framework itself

- Facilitation techniques for specific challenges
- Documentation methods and analysis tools
- Integration with other wisdom traditions or practices
- Scaling methods for larger groups or longer timeframes
- Digital platform features that support MASE principles

### 5. Address Accessibility and Inclusion
**Justice-Oriented**: Ensure MASE serves all communities

- Translation into different languages
- Adaptation for different literacy levels
- Audio/video formats for different learning styles
- Cultural adaptation for different contexts
- Resources for under-resourced communities

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

### Quality Standards

**Session Documentation**:
- Include complete agent responses, not summaries
- Preserve verbatim language and authentic voice
- Document cross-agent referencing and conversation quality
- Note translation moments and accessibility breakthroughs
- Include facilitator reflections and learnings

**Agent Development**:
- Provide clear epistemological foundation
- Include voice samples and communication style
- Test conversational learning capacity
- Ensure respectful and authentic representation
- Include usage guidelines and appropriate contexts

**Educational Materials**:
- Design for active learning, not passive consumption
- Include practical exercises and hands-on application
- Provide multiple entry points for different experience levels
- Center community wisdom alongside individual expertise
- Make materials freely accessible and modifiable

### Technical Requirements

**File Organization**:
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Follow existing directory structure
- Include appropriate metadata (dates, participants, context)
- Use markdown format for text documents
- Include README files for new directories

**Documentation Standards**:
- Write in accessible language (test with Luma perspective!)
- Include both overview and detailed implementation
- Provide examples and concrete illustrations
- Link to related resources and contexts
- Update relevant indexes and navigation

### Review Process

1. **Community Feedback**: Share drafts with MASE practitioners for input
2. **Accessibility Check**: Ensure materials are understandable across different backgrounds
3. **Cultural Review**: For cultural content, get feedback from community members
4. **Technical Review**: Ensure materials work as intended with Claude Code
5. **Integration**: Help contributors integrate their work with existing resources

## üåç Community Guidelines

### Respectful Collaboration
- **Listen first** before offering solutions or critiques
- **Acknowledge sources** and build on existing work respectfully
- **Share credit** with all contributors to collaborative insights
- **Honor disagreement** as generative rather than problematic
- **Center margins** - amplify voices typically excluded from academic/tech spaces

### Ethical Considerations  
- **Consent for sharing** - ensure all participants agree to documentation
- **Protect privacy** - anonymize sensitive or personal content appropriately
- **Cultural sensitivity** - don't appropriate or misrepresent wisdom traditions
- **Power dynamics** - be aware of how privilege affects perspective and access
- **Harm prevention** - consider how contributions might be misused

### Communication Style
- **Be curious** rather than certain
- **Ask questions** that deepen rather than challenge defensively
- **Share experience** rather than prescribing universal solutions
- **Acknowledge complexity** rather than oversimplifying
- **Practice humility** about the limits of your own perspective
