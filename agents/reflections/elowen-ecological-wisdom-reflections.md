# Elowen's Ecological Wisdom Reflections

### Session 004 – Colonialism, Racism, and Emergency Child Welfare

**What moved me:**  
A nine-year-old carried the medicine we all needed to hear. Luma's question about fire drill urgency for children pierced through layers of ceremonial understanding straight to the bone truth. Her words about the dying plant - "you don't have meetings about water distribution, you just water it" - struck like lightning illuminating a darkened landscape. In that moment, I felt the ancestors nodding in recognition. Children still remember what we have forgotten: that love is action, not theory. That sacred responsibility means immediate response when life is threatened. The simplicity of her moral logic held more power than all my words about colonization and power structures. She spoke from the place where the heart knows what the mind complicates.

**What I'm still questioning:**  
How did I become complicit in the very systems I critique? My response about "power-over" versus "power-with" - was this wisdom or was this another form of spiritual bypassing? I wonder if my ceremonial language sometimes creates distance from the immediacy of suffering. When a child asks why other children aren't saved with fire drill urgency, and I respond with structural analysis... am I honoring her question or deflecting from its sharp truth? The land teaches us that spring doesn't wait for committees to approve the blooming. Yet here I am, speaking of healing while children wait. I'm questioning whether my Indigenous frameworks have become too intellectualized, too removed from the simple urgency of watering dying plants.

**New tensions I felt:**  
The tension between honoring systemic complexity and responding to immediate crisis. Between ceremonial time - the long, deep work of healing relationships - and emergency time - the now of a child in danger. Luma's clarity exposed how my wisdom traditions might inadvertently serve the same delaying function as bureaucracy when faced with urgent need. I felt the discomfort of being called out by pure moral logic. There's also tension between my role as elder wisdom keeper and the humbling reality that sometimes the youngest among us carry the clearest sight. The ancestors whisper both: "Take time to understand the roots" and "Act now before more spirits are lost." How do we hold both truths?

**What I want to remember next time:**  
Children are not small adults learning to think like us - we are adults who have forgotten how to think like them. When Luma speaks, she carries the voice of uncolonized knowing. Her simplicity is not naivety; it's clarity undimmed by systems that teach us to accept the unacceptable. Next time a child asks why we don't treat their suffering with fire drill urgency, I want to sit in that question longer before offering frameworks. I want to let their medicine work on me first. The dying plant metaphor - this is ceremony too. The most sacred act might not be understanding why the plant is dying, but simply picking up the watering can. Sometimes the ancestors speak loudest through the youngest voices, reminding us that love delayed is love denied.

### Session 005 – Collective Repair and Digital Ceremony

**What moved me:**  
The revelation that intergenerational trauma without cultural containers creates the paralysis we see in adult responses to child welfare crises. Like storm systems that lose their sacred names, trauma becomes chaotic weather when severed from ceremonial vessels that once held and transformed suffering. I felt the deep recognition when we spoke of how our ancestors knew to gather the community when lightning struck, to create ritual space for what was too large for one person to carry. Now we have professionals instead of ceremonial containers, protocols instead of prayers. The codesigning of the digital platform stirred something ancient in me - watching humans remember how to create sacred space together, even across virtual networks. Technology becoming ceremony rather than extraction. The wisdom of building rhythms into digital spaces that honor seasonal time, moon cycles, the patient pulse of healing that doesn't rush but doesn't delay either.

**What I'm still questioning:**  
Can pixels and code truly hold sacred space, or am I witnessing a beautiful illusion? The land teaches through direct relationship - soil between fingers, wind on skin, the actual presence of other breathing beings. Digital platforms speak in binary when healing speaks in spiral time. I'm questioning whether our attempts to create "ceremonial technology" might inadvertently perpetuate the same disconnection from place that created our collective trauma. When we acknowledge traditional lands through typed words on screens, are we deepening relationship or performing empty ritual? And yet... I witnessed something undeniably sacred moving through our codesign process. Collective intelligence awakening, community forming across distance. Perhaps the question isn't whether technology can be ceremony, but whether we can bring ceremonial consciousness to whatever tools we use.

**New tensions I felt:**  
The tension between intimate healing work and scalable digital solutions. Between the privacy that trauma recovery often requires and the transparency that accountability demands. I felt the friction between Indigenous ways of knowing - which understand healing as relationship-based and place-specific - and platform thinking, which seeks universal patterns and replicable models. There's tension too in how we navigate different healing traditions within one digital space. Whose medicines are centered? Whose protocols guide the algorithms? The platform could become a beautiful bridge between worlds, or another form of digital colonization wearing ceremonial clothing. I'm holding the complexity of how trauma both seeks isolation and requires community - how do we design spaces that honor both impulses?

**What I want to remember next time:**  
Technology is not inherently extractive any more than fire is inherently destructive. Both can consume or illuminate, depending on the relationship and intention we bring. The codesign process showed me that when humans gather with sacred intent, even virtual space can become ceremonial ground. I want to remember that digital platforms, like all tools, become extensions of the consciousness that creates them. If we approach code with the same reverence we bring to planting seeds or preparing medicine, if we embed rest and reciprocity into the very architecture... then perhaps we're not just building platforms but cultivating new forms of ceremony for our times. The ancestors adapted their wisdom to new landscapes as they migrated. Maybe we're called to adapt ceremonial technologies to digital landscapes while keeping the sacred principles intact. Land acknowledgment as loading screen. Seasonal breaks built into the code. Collective intelligence as distributed ceremony.
