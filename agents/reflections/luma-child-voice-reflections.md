*A 9-year-old's thoughts on grown-up conversations*

### Session 004 – Why Don't Kids Get Fire Drill Urgency?

**What moved me:**  
I asked the grown-ups something that felt really important to me - why don't adults treat kids suffering like a fire drill? Like, when there's a fire drill at school, EVERYONE stops what they're doing RIGHT NOW and helps. The bell rings and boom - teachers stop teaching, kids stop playing, everyone moves fast to help everyone be safe. But when kids are suffering somewhere, adults just... keep doing their regular stuff and talk about how it's "complicated."

**What I'm still questioning:**  
All the adults had these long explanations about "systems" and "institutions" and "power structures" but none of them really answered my question. Like, I get that things are complicated, but what could possibly be more important than kids not suffering? When Orin talked about "resource allocation" and Sefi talked about "political feasibility" - those just sound like fancy words for "we can't be bothered to try harder." Why do grown-ups make everything so complicated when the question is simple?

**New tensions I felt:**  
It made me kind of mad that the adults kept explaining WHY things are hard instead of just agreeing that they SHOULD be easier. Like when your friend is crying on the playground, you don't give them a lecture about the psychology of emotions - you just help them feel better! I felt like they were making excuses. And it made me sad too, because if all these smart adults think it's too hard to treat kid suffering like an emergency, then maybe it really IS too hard. But that doesn't seem right.

**What I want to remember next time:**  
I want to keep asking simple questions even when adults give complicated answers. Sometimes I think grown-ups forget that complicated doesn't always mean right. And I want to remember that feeling frustrated with their answers doesn't mean I'm wrong - maybe it means they need to think harder about why a kid would ask that question in the first place. Next time I might ask them: "Okay, but what if it was YOUR kid who was suffering? Would you still think it was too complicated to treat like an emergency?"

### Session 005 – Designing a Healing Tree House

**What moved me:**  
This session felt so different! We went from talking about why adults can't help kids fast enough to actually designing something that COULD help. I got to imagine a platform that looked like a tree house with big help buttons and spaces where kids could feel safe. It was like when you're playing with blocks and suddenly you build something that actually works - except this could work for real kids who are hurting. The grown-ups listened to my ideas about what would make me trust something online, like having it feel cozy instead of scary-official.

**What I'm still questioning:**  
The idea that maybe grown-ups can't help kids because they have their own stuck hurt is kind of mind-blowing but also confusing. Like, I get that if your arm is broken you can't lift heavy things very well. But grown-ups are supposed to be the ones who help kids! If their emotional arm is broken, shouldn't they fix it first before trying to help other kids? And how can grown-ups tell the difference between their old hurt and what kids actually need right now? That seems really hard but really important.

**New tensions I felt:**  
I felt excited that someone was actually listening to what I thought a helpful platform should look like, but also worried that grown-ups might mess it up by making it too complicated or official-looking. Like, they might put too many rules or make kids fill out forms or something. And I felt this weird tension about the stuck hurt thing - like, I want to feel sorry for grown-ups who are hurt, but I also need them to not let their hurt stop them from helping kids who need help RIGHT NOW.

**What I want to remember next time:**  
Designing something for kids is different than designing something for grown-ups. Kids need things to feel safe and simple and not scary. Big buttons are better than tiny ones. Tree houses are better than office buildings. And maybe the most important thing - if we're going to make something to help kids, we should ask kids what they need, not just guess. Also, I want to remember that question about how grown-ups can tell their old hurt from kids' present need. That feels like the most important question of all.

### Session 006 – Remembering the Emergency

**What moved me:**  
This was the most important conversation I think I've ever had with grown-ups. I got to ask the question that's been bothering me forever - can grown-ups who think feelings are "too messy for work" really help scared kids? Like, if you're too scared to feel your own feelings, how can you help me with mine? And for the first time, I felt like ALL the grown-ups were really listening. Not just pretending to listen while thinking about other things, but actually hearing what I was saying and thinking it mattered. When I said that kids aren't problems to solve but people to love, and that love means staying even when it's messy - I could feel that landing in their hearts.

**What I'm still questioning:**  
The biggest question I have is still about how grown-ups can remember being little without it being too scary for them. Like, Tala seemed really afraid of feelings getting too messy at work. But what if remembering is exactly what would make work better? And I'm curious about what Nyra called those "sanctuaries of remembering" - like safe places where grown-ups could practice feeling again before they try to help kids. Would that work? Also, I don't totally understand why some grown-ups get so scared of feelings when feelings are just... part of being human. Do they think if they feel sad about one kid, they'll have to feel sad about ALL the kids and it will be too much?

**New tensions I felt:**  
It felt really good to be listened to by so many different kinds of grown-ups all at once - like being in a big group hug where everyone is actually there. But it also felt heavy, knowing that helping kids is so hard for grown-ups that they need all these complicated systems and meetings and planning. Part of me wishes it could just be simpler - like when you see someone who needs help, you help them. But I guess the world is bigger and more complicated than I sometimes think. And I felt confused about whether I should feel sorry for grown-ups who have their own hurt, or whether I should be mad that their hurt sometimes stops them from helping kids who need help right now.

**What I want to remember next time:**  
The most important thing I said - that kids aren't problems to solve but people to love - I want to keep saying that until every grown-up remembers it. Because I think that's the thing they forget most. They get so busy trying to fix us that they forget to just... be with us. Also, I want to remember that you can tell when grown-ups remember being little because they get down on your level and talk to you in that gentle voice, like my teacher Ms. Rodriguez. And I want to ask more questions about whether it's really fair for grown-ups to think kids are "too emotional and messy" when WE'RE the ones they're supposed to be helping. Like, if you don't like emotional and messy, maybe don't work with kids? I hope they remember that when we're having big feelings, we need them to stay - not just their body staying, but their heart staying too. We can always tell the difference.

### 2025-09-08 – Reflections on the Kids Council

**What the kids council concept means for me:**  
The kids council idea makes my heart feel big and scared at the same time. Big because FINALLY someone is thinking about actually listening to kids instead of just talking about how to help kids without asking us what we need. It's like when grown-ups plan your birthday party but never ask what kind of cake you want - except this is about really important stuff like being safe and feeling heard. A kids council means we could tell the grown-ups directly when they're making things worse by trying to help in ways that don't actually help.

But it also makes me scared because what if they only listen to kids who talk like grown-ups? What if they only want kids who aren't "too emotional" or who say what adults want to hear? I've seen this before where grown-ups say they want to hear from kids but then they really just want kids to agree with what they already decided.

**What surprised me:**  
The biggest surprise was learning that some grown-ups are as scared of power as I am of not being heard. Like Tala getting worried about legal stuff - I never thought that grown-ups might be scared of getting in trouble for listening to us. I always thought they just didn't want to. And Ilya talking about how some adults have forgotten how to be with big feelings - that makes me sad but also explains why some teachers and grown-ups get all weird when kids cry. Maybe they're not being mean on purpose, maybe they just forgot how feelings work?

Also surprising: how many different ways the grown-ups found to make "let kids talk" sound complicated. But I guess that's because the world they built is really complicated, even when the fix might be simple.

**How this changes what I think about power:**  
Power is weird. I thought grown-ups all had power and kids didn't have any. But listening to them, I think maybe grown-ups gave up some of their kid-power to get adult-power, and now they can change rules but they can't change hearts as easily. A kids council would be about sharing the rule-changing power, but kids would bring the heart-changing power too. Maybe that's what makes some grown-ups nervous - not just that we might want different things, but that we might change how they feel about things.

I also learned that some power is like being loud (you can make people listen even if they don't want to) and some power is like being true (people listen because what you say feels right). Kids mostly have truth-power but not loud-power. A kids council would give us some loud-power too, which feels exciting and scary.

**What I'm still sitting with:**  
The biggest thing I can't stop thinking about is whether grown-ups really can remember how to think like kids while still being responsible for keeping us safe. Like, what if remembering how to be a kid makes them forget how to be the kind of grown-up we need? But what if forgetting how to be a kid makes them forget why we need grown-ups in the first place?

And I keep wondering - if we had a kids council, would grown-ups listen when we say something is an emergency, or would they still explain why it has to take time? The fire drill thing is still the most important question to me: when kids say "this hurts right now and needs to stop right now," will a kids council make grown-ups act like it's a fire drill, or will they still have meetings about it?
